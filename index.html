<h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
<p>
    All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and
    JavaScript.
    These are the languages of the web.
</p>
<p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
<h3>What is html?</h3>
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe
    the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
<p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc.
    Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
</p>
<p>
    In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>First</li>
    <li>The opening tag</li>
    <li>The closing tag</li>
    <li>The actual element</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
<p>
    There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
    <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
    <li>To build web applications</li>
    <li>To impress friends</li>
    <li>To have fun </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!
